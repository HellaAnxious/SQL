## This is my "final" SQL project I did while learning SQL

-- 1 Show customers (full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, customers.CustomerID, customers.country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE customers.country <> 'USA';

-- 2 Show only the customers from Brazil

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, customers.CustomerID, customers.country
FROM chinook.customers

-- 3 Find the invoices of customers who are from Brazil. (Table should include
-- customer's full name, invoice ID, date, and billing country).

SELECT customers.FirstName, customers.LastName, invoices.InvoiceID, invoices.InvoiceDate,
invoices.BillingCountry

WHERE customers.country = 'Brazil';

-- 4 Show the employees who are sales agents.

SELECT * 
FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE '%Sales%';

-- 5 Find a unique/distint list of billing countries from the invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT invoices.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

-- 6 Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.
-- Table should include the agent's full name.

SELECT employees.firstname, employees.lastname, invoices.invoiceid

-- 7 Show the invoice total, customer name, country and sales agent for all invoices &
-- customers.

SELECT CUS.FirstName as 'Customer First Name', CUS.LastName as 'Customer Last Name',

-- 8 How many invoices where there in 2009?

SELECT COUNT(*)

-- 12 Provide a query that shows all the tracks, and include the album name, media type,
-- and genre.

-- 13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.

FROM chinook.invoices i

LEFT JOIN chinook.employees e

-- 15 List 10 billing cities that had the most sales.

SELECT i.BillingCity, ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) as Total_Sales
FROM chinook.invoices i
GROUP BY BillingCity
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(i.total), 2) DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- How many tracks were sold in 2009's top billing cities?
